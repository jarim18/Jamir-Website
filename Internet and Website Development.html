        <h2>Introduction to the World Wide Web (WWW)</h2>
        <p>The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to provide the client a copy of the webpage. This message, as well as any other data communicated between the client and the server, is transmitted via TCP/IP across your internet connection. A web server's primary function is to show website content by storing, processing, and distributing webpages to users. A web browser is an application that allows you to access and view webpages. Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, and Google Chrome are examples of popular web browsers.  </p>

        <h2>How is the world wide web different to the internet?</h2>
        <p>Because of their distinct activities and purposes, the internet differs from the World Wide Web. The internet is a network that allows computers to connect with one another. They accomplish this through the use of networks, both wired and wireless. Users can utilise the internet to chat, send data, have conferences, and access the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web connects webpages and other digital media to devices. The Internet is the system via which they communicate with one another. </p>

        <h2>What is an intranet? How does it relate to the internet?</h2>
        <p>An intranet is a private network within an organisation that allows employeesÂ to securely exchange company information and computing resources. An intranet can also be utilised for group collaboration and teleconferences. Intranets promote internal communication inside a company. It is not, however, the same as the Internet, which is a globally connected network of computers that allows people to share information and communicate with one another. An intranet, on the other hand, is a local or restricted network that allows employees within a company to store, organise, and share information.</p>

        <h2>What is an internet protocol? Compare HTTP,TCP/IP and FTP. </h2>
        <p> An internet protocol is a set of rules (protocols) that manages the transmission of data from an alphabetic message or file into computer language and then back into an alphabetic message for our understanding. The Internet Protocol is separated into five protocols, each of which handles a distinct role while working together to convey data. The application, transport, internet, link, and physical protocols constitute the five levels. The application protocol is where the communication is sent, which is commonly HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). FTP (file transfer protocol) is a protocol that allows files or data to be sent between two computers.TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is used by the transport layer to break the message into blocks called packets and check if all of it has been loaded in. </p>
